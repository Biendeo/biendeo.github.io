## Who is this guy?
I'm a fellow Australian who enjoys video games and music. I've been running a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/Biendeo) for a while where I commentate playthroughs of various video games I've enjoyed (and some not so much enjoyed). I've also been live streaming these playthroughs on [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/Biendeo) before the end up on YouTube.

I also do some hobby programming on the side. My big project that I work on is a modular Discord bot in C# called [BlendoBot](https://github.com/BlendoBot). I really want to keep toying around with different things and learn more about programming, as well as make other cool projects later on!

## So what do you post here?
On this blog I'll be posting either things I'm working on, opinions, or just generally writing about things I've experienced and done. I want to put some thoughts on things I do down in written form so I can remind myself about it later, and perhaps you might enjoy what I write here!
