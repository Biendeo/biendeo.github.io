[ { "title": "Review - Stuart Little 2 (PS1)", "url": "/posts/review-stuart-little-2-ps1/", "categories": "Review", "tags": "video-game, review, ps1, collectathon, retroachievements", "date": "2022-06-26 16:14:00 +1000", "snippet": "It’s 6 levels that’ll take you about 20 minutes each to understand each and collect everything, concluded by a lacklustre boss. Inoffensive until it ends.This just randomly came on my radar as a collect-a-thon game developed by the same people as Muppet Monster Madness (a game I have streamed before), but it’s been probably 20 years since I last saw Stuart Little 2, and I cannot for the life of me remember what even happens in it. Popping in the game you’re greeted with a very basic menu with Stuart in his little car, followed by a rather simple 3D platforming tutorial with the bird (named Margalo) giving you a tutorial on how to play. It controls very similarly to Muppet Monster Madness with running mapped to R1, a spin attack mapped to Circle, and a throw button mapped to Square. The throw items are effectively just an ammo you pick up, and I never found I was running out of them since you just loosely point at an enemy, press Square, and see it go down in one hit. You also get the usual platforming tropes of climbing walls with pink handprints on them, climbing up ropes, swimming, and double-jumping. Nothing offensive, just nothing exceptional.After the tutorial you’re immediately thrust into the first level, the Downstairs. There’s a few rooms to navigate, and you’re immediately bombarded with feedback on collecting things. To put it simply, there are 80 fish biscuit items in the level; you collect at least 60 of them, and deliver them to a red cat bowl to reveal a piece of jewellery (effectively the game’s Power Stars, crystalised dragon, whatever you believe the main collectable is). There are also 6 blocks with Stuart’s face on it, which, when all collected, open up a pathway at one corner of the level to another piece of jewellery. There’s a key that opens a yellow chest with, you guessed it, one piece of jewellery. There’s one piece chilling out somewhere in the level, and lastly, there’s two challenges (similar to Spyro 2’s side challenges), both giving a piece of jewellery. Just to top it off, there’s a special movie clip hidden in each level that doesn’t contribute towards anything other than giving you a movie clip.Now the game doesn’t really explain this ahead of time, so I got a little confused because I was greeted by a tutorial where Snowbell (the cat) would take me from one level to the next after I had picked up enough pieces of jewellery), which can either be triggered by the menu or from the various pink tokens situated in the level. But Snowbell also supposedly trades the fish biscuits for a piece of jewellery at one specific part of the level. It took me until level 3 before I accidentally walked next to the red cat bowl and triggered the sequence to convert the fish biscuits for the jewellery. Fortunately, returning to a previous level keeps everything unlocked, so I could easily pick up the remaining things I had missed.The minigame challenges are rather uninteresting due to their brevity. A couple of the challenges are these ones where you’re on a toy track of some kind, leaning to sides of the train to pick up stars to continue the game (and reaching the end gives you the jewellery). Some others involved flying a plane (by steering only left and right) to pick up stars, some are on a skateboard, some just involve running through checkpoints in a time limit, and some involve a boat. They’re not particularly interesting or hard. I also noticed on one level the description said to pick up all 25 stars, before being prompted and required to pick up 30 of them instead. They just feel slapped on, but they’re also the only bit of variety the game really has.Because each of the six levels plays exactly the same. You try to get your bearings, but ultimately every level consists of a number of rooms connected via some openings, and most of the interesting stuff involves climbing up each of these rooms and following the trails of fish biscuits until you reach some kind of dead end. Repeat for each room, and then backtrack a bit around after you’ve picked up the face blocks and the keys. After the Downstairs level, you visit Central Park (which has a surprising number of high walls around you), the upstairs of the house, the sewers (complete with electrified beams), an alley way, and a…garbage ship? But they all feel so similar because the perspective is rather close to the ground, and most of the levels share the same generic enemies of insects and spiders. And occasionally a toy robot. In the sewers of all places.Since the game felt a bit repetitive, I started focussing on some other aspects of the game. The actual character of Stuart Little is very well modelled for a PS1 title, but the environments are rather simple in design, and you’ll frequently see incredibly basic surroundings in the distance. On a handful of the levels including the final boss, you’re in a vehicle where the ground is entirely a flat colour, and the background is an incredibly low LOD model of something (a city? A wall? I’m not sure). It looks hideous and incomplete. Stuart’s voice acting is quite bizarre; it doesn’t sound like Michael Fox, and you’ll hear the same voice lines of “hurgh” every time you double jump and “I’ve collected enough cat biscuits for Snowbell to trade with Monte” every time…well you know. Margalo also chimes in whenever you’ve collected another piece of jewellery or a face block, which happens…36 times in the game. If the game takes 3 hours, that’s on average every 5 minutes.The music probably shares the same composer as the Muppet Monster Madness game, but it’s bizarrely dramatic using MIDI orchestral sounds all over the place. None of it is crazy memorable; I kept being reminded of the Toy Story 2 PS1 game (which also shares some of this game’s menu presentation). I can’t recall if Stuart Little ever had a theme song, but it’s also impossible to know because very bizarrely the FMV sequences between levels do not have any music. It has the dialogue and sound effects from the film, but it goes completely silent whenever there should only be music playing, giving it a very surreal feeling during scenes like the ending when Margalo leaves. It’s just silent. I also thought it was strange how out of order the FMV sequences were; level 5’s FMV had the scene where Stuart meets Margalo while driving, which, in the game, has already happened after Margalo gave you a tutorial and was in every level, and in the FMV sequences, had already been injured and watched Stuart go down a drainpipe.The first and final boss is against Falcon, the evil bird guy, who’s chasing Margalo. You fly a plane, pick up batteries, and then press X to dash forward and hit him. You’re supposed to also dodge obstacles and do some laps, but I seemed to pick up enough batteries and defeat Falcon before I even made a lap around the obstacle course.Overall this game came and went so quickly. Games like this is exactly why I wanted to write these kinds of brief reviews; because the shorter experiences would disappear so quickly from my memory that I’d barely even remember what they were. And, as a game that took just under 3 hours to completely beat with no prior knowledge of it in any way, it was effectively a blip; something I played and I’ll probably never play again. The bad parts are mostly just small tid-bits like the visuals being rather weak for a PS1 game (and especially one that came out in 2002, which isn’t it strange this is the only version of the game out there?), or the difficulty being way too easy. But it also was not uniquely fun in any way; it only serves as a curious thing to note and compare to. It played fine, and was competent at what it set out to do, but it was so unambitious that it feels a bit insulting that people would’ve paid some amount of money to own this, only to be done with it in just as much time as the actual movie itself. I’d probably say just watch that instead." }, { "title": "Review - XIII (PC)", "url": "/posts/review-xiii-pc/", "categories": "Review", "tags": "video-game, review, pc, fps, steam", "date": "2022-06-20 07:00:00 +1000", "snippet": "A varied and decent FPS, graced by a unique art style and soundtrack, but littered with annoying gameplay mechanics and unfortunately poor PC scaling performance.XIII’s been on my radar for a while after seeing a Gggmanlives video on it ages ago. It seemed like an interesting game to play, especially given that it was some obscure early 2000s shooter by Ubisoft Paris of all studios. It had one sequel in 2011, and a remake in 2020, but it never really got mentioned in any way otherwise to me. So to me, it’d be an interesting ride at least.The first thing I experienced when starting the game is that you cannot change the screen resolution beyond a 4:3 aspect ratio without going into the config, and then you had to manually adjust the FOV in the config again to make it feel comfortable. It’s not unheard of, but it’s an extra step, and a little odd given that this game runs on the Unreal Engine 2; an engine that certainly has games that support non-4:3 aspect ratios fairly decently. Fortunately there was an unofficial patch 1.4.2.1 linked on PCGW that set up the 16:9 ratio okay (although I still had to tweak the config to get to 2560x1440). Afterwards, it was apparent that the menus were not scaling, taking up a smaller square region in the centre of my screen. While not an issue at first, later on I felt that I was struggling to read the health counters in the bottom left of the screen while playing, resulting in a couple of unfortunate deaths.But the biggest issue of running at this custom resolution is unfortunately how various visual effects do not properly handle any resolution above 640x480. There’s a sequence immediately as the game starts where you have to walk down a beach following a woman while being very dazed from waking up. The game tries to do a blur effect by layering the rendered scene onto the screen multiple times with different transparency levels. But these post-processing layers were obviously written to work under a fixed resolution which means you as a player see a very low resolution view with incredibly jagged (but filtered) pixels, which then gets blurred even further as part of the effect. Then as the game tries to bring your character back into consciousness, the game suddenly snaps the effect off and looks perfectly fine at the monitor’s target resolution. This blurry effect happens also with the various flashback sequences in the game, as well as for any overlayed comic book panel that frequently shows up for added effect.But I’m probably overstating the severity of that effect, because you’ll quickly put it aside to focus on the story. The game starts with a full motion video cutscene of the fictional president being assassinated, an evil guy saying “Number XIII will no longer be a problem”, a military guy talking about leading his own investigation, and then you waking up on a beach. You quickly pick up a throwing knife and a pistol, and get started taking out the people ambushing you. The game’s cel-shaded art style takes full centre stage immediately with its hard shadows providing strong contrast on the player’s hands. This is complemented by the sunset on the beach dock, resulting in a slightly dimmed and orange colour palette, lit mildly by lamps highlighting the way. Enemies pop up on ledges, and the game highlights them with a red rectangle and a sound to help indicate that they’re up there, and shooting them down results in a comic book panel overlay showing them falling down to the ground with floating letters spelling AAAAAHHHH as they go. It all comes at you fast, and it’s a great way to get the game going immediately.The level ends with you reaching a car, and you begin another level at the bank, where you follow some people into your vault. You get a flashback sequence once your inside showing that you had set up a bomb, only to spring upon it now in the present time. These flashback sequences provide some level of intrigue early on in the game, but it feels clear not too long into the game that there’s not as much mystery as I had hoped. The main character having amnesia does allow the story to go in some more interesting routes early on, but he figures things out fairly quickly, and unfortunately the villains are very obviously villains and have no secret there.The rest of the bank level introduces the other component to the game: stealth. You have to not kill the guards by slamming them with chairs and brooms, and, while you can run up and slap them, you ideally want to crouch and get closer to them first. The game tries to indicate unaware guards by showing a TAP every step they make, but I did find it easier to just learn the patterns the hard way in more cases than not. You also get to take a person hostage, which allows you to walk through an area with the guards eyeing you but not shooting. Unless you turn 90 degrees to the side, which then they immediately open fire, probably hitting whoever you’ve held hostage.Afterwards, you’re arrested by the FBI for supposedly murdering the president, and you escape out, again, by stealthing past all the FBI guards. It’s complicated a bit by having guys you actually need to shoot in the mix, but the section is fairly short, so I never found it an issue to try and spot which people my crosshair told me not to shoot, and which people I had to. You then get a grappling hook (which controls fairly well since you get to control your momentum fairly easily), and you get to use a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher on your escape down to the ground. You then get taken to a Siberian military complex to rescue a General, and escape on a cable car, with a part at the end where you man a mounted turret while a helicopter gets fixed.Shortly after this section, you get captured and taken to a mental asylum, where one of the boss villains shows up at the end. It was an interesting fight as he takes a disturbing amount of bullets, while trying to run up to you and stab you with needles. It’s not hard, but it begins to highlight a major issue with this game: the checkpoints. You cannot manually save; pressing the quicksave key just writes to a file where you were at the last checkpoint, and most levels consist of a few checkpoints. I think the furthest a checkpoint was for me was maybe 4 minutes of solid gameplay, so they’re fairly frequent. But annoyingly, in this scenario and a few others, you have to do a boss fight, only to then have a precarious sequence afterwards that’s easy to fail. In this case it’s moving a hostage out of some hallways while lots of people come at you from many angles. In other cases it’s a stealth section that’s a bit too easy to fail. Ironically, I found the easiest way to do the hostage scenario was to ditch the hostage and just start shooting people one at a time again, against the game’s desires. But then the cutscene at the end had the hostage driving the ambulance out of the place so I’m not sure what the game intended.The rest of the game now involves taking out various significant members of the 20, a secret society of people who were probably behind the assassination; I wasn’t really too sure how this organisation came to be, they’re just presented like they’re the villains and that’s that. You head off down a canyon, to a military base, onto a submarine, off into a docking bay, into a hotel where you conduct an FBI sting, into an old chateau where you come across a KKK meeting (I dunno, probably to indicate that the villains are still evil), and finally into a secret government base to protect the next president for one last showdown with the big villains. There’s a surprising number of stealth sections throughout this game, for example, you can’t be seen in the military base, or the Siberian base, or the submarine, or the hotel, or the KKK meeting, or the government base. I think out of the 32 maps in the game, about 12 of them have a stealth section of some kind. Sometimes you’re able to kill the enemies with a crossbow or silenced pistol, but sometimes you have to resort to the chair and broom method again. But you fortunately get a bit of leeway as getting detected only counts if an enemy runs over and hits a button. This is a problem in the submarine level though, where enemies are on walkways above you all over the place, allowing them to see you through the ground, and hit the button where they are, while you’re unable to shoot through the walkways to stop them.The other uncomfortable part of the game is the actual gunplay itself. Since every enemy fires a weapon of some kind at you, you’re not really encouraged to go up too close to enemies unless you’re in a very tight interior location. Early on that’s okay for the shotgun, but I found it was so inadequate at taking down enemies before they could hit me in more scenarios than not. The pistol and the revolver were surprisingly good at doing long range kills, and coupled with the crossbow and sniper rifle, they seemed alright. Strangely, you get an M4 rifle with an underslug grenade launcher at various points in the game, but the accuracy was so abysmal on it. I’d burst fire carefully, and I’d struggle to get one kill before having to reload. I preferred the quicker kills of the pistol, even though I had to reload more often with that. On the flip side, you get an M50 LMG, which seems to immediately kill enemies after a few taps, work at a long range, and not need to reload too often, and that ended up being my goto weapon in many cases.You’re provided with a decent number of health kits throughout the game, some small ones that only recover 25 health, and some larger ones that recover 75 health. You don’t have to eat these up right away; you’re allowed to carry 5 of each as you go, and they often carry over between levels too, so I never felt too outclassed to heal until the final two bosses of the game. Unfortunately, there were times I did just suddenly die because enemies decided to get a bit too lucky with their blind fire, taking down half of my health in a few frames just by spraying down a long dockside or some similar scenario. This sudden and inconsistent difficulty got rather annoying throughout the game, especially when your weapons are taken away from you arbitrarily between levels. For example, before the canyon levels, I had a pistol, an M4, and a shotgun. Then the canyon level presented me with only my M4, forcing me to struggle in defeating enemies.I explicitly mentioned the last two bosses because they get to use some incredibly powerful weapons against you, and since you can’t hit them without them being able to hit you, you have to just trial and error get lucky with your poor accuracy weapons until you just so happen to defeat them. And the bosses end up becoming more bullet spongey as the game goes on unfortunately. I like the idea of having these bosses as milestones in the story but they seem to never feel like proper challenges; either being incredibly weak or too dumb strong.Lastly, the level design is a little top heavy. I think it’s very strong at the beginning with levels like the bank, and the military base, which gracefully guide you throughout the levels with enemies and open doors without holding your hand a lot. But later on, they sometimes get a bit too cryptic for my liking. There’s a part late in the game where you can see a panel where you have to find a Tetris block shaped key to activate it, and there’s only two rooms so not much to look for, but I kept going back and forth so many times until I discovered that there’s a false wall panel which reveals the key. It’s the only time in the game there even is a false panel, but it happens. There was another time earlier on where you had to identify that there was a bush that you could walk through to continue the level as well.Overall though, I think the highs in this game are a bit infrequent, and the more frustrating parts seem to stay a bit too long afterwards. But, there’s a decent 7 hour campaign in there, and it’s certainly an interesting game nonetheless. The visuals have aged a bit but they style can still easily be felt, and the gameplay’s weakest parts are more to do with the more ambitious parts of the game, and not the things that it followed with other contemporary games of its time. The soundtrack is pretty good, giving that dramatic spy sensation, and there’s a bunch of variety in the settings of the game. It’s not perfect, and it’s not absolutely amazing either, but it’s got some charm, and, with a bit of perseverance, can be enjoyed a bit today. But only a bit; you will experience those frustrations and it unfortunately does last throughout the game, offsetting some of the better aspects a bit too much." }, { "title": "Review - Illusion of Gaia (SNES)", "url": "/posts/review-illusion-of-gaia-snes/", "categories": "Review", "tags": "video-game, review, snes, jrpg, retroachievements", "date": "2022-06-12 10:21:00 +1000", "snippet": "A solid 12-hour adventure with various developments both in environments and story, albeit with unexpectedly difficult bosses and a bit of a confusing ending.I had only ever heard of Illusion of Gaia in various “best of SNES RPGs” lists around the internet, but I had never seen any gameplay, or played any of the developer Quintet’s other titles. This was a bit of a blind “let’s see how we go” kind of pick. Immediately I’m greeted by some fairly strong SNES styled presentation; the title screen has a fairly artsy shot of the logo on top of the Earth, the music invoking a grand orchestral tone with its horns and timpani drums, and an introduction sequence featuring copious amounts of Mode 7 perspective to illustrate the grandeur of the story.Starting the game, you play as Will, finishing a class with his friends, where you can immediately take control and run around the world. The movement feels fluid and nothing feels too hand-holdy in this beginning sections of the game, as a character tells you not to jump off rooftops that have ledges, etc. What’s quite odd is the location is a fairly dense cliffside village with various buildings, a boat dock, and people carrying pots. But then on the roof of the starting building, you’re greeting by a mystical portal that takes you into a spooky room filled with warping stars and a greyscale statue of Gaia, who tells you that you are the chosen one with the Dark Power. Gaia’s role in this game is to briefly describe any tutorials as you progress the game, and to provide healing and saves. But I was intrigued early on by the setting of the game, as it hints at these fantasy elements without quite leaning too hard into it.Soon you’re introduced to Kara and her pig, Oinky, who have snuck in against her father’s intents. She is quickly whisked away by guards, but the next day you are given a letter from the King (her father), ordering you to come visit. You’re also taught a song that you can play on your flute, a mechanic that comes up at various contextual points later in the game. Finally you’re told that your father went on an expedition to the Tower of Babel a year ago but had never returned, which hints at something grander.The world map surprisingly is just a list of destinations, and contextually through the game you’re only ever given three locations to visit at a time, so there’s no wait to visit the King. Kara, who is now grounded in the castle, alludes to you that her father is acting weirdly. The King asks for a Crystal Ring, which you don’t have, and saying yes or no to him angers him so much he throws you into jail, where you’re forced to wait for a minute (receiving a brief mystical phone call from your long-lost father through the flute you possess) until you’re rescued by Oinky, who brings a key to the cell.It is at this point you get to engage in the meat and bones of the gameplay; much of which reminds me of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. You maintain the same top-down view and movement controls as before, but you can now swing your sword with A, and can equip an item in the Select menu and use it with B. Enemies take taps from your sword (or staff?), and they satisfyingly reel back after every hit. But this game is more of an RPG like Zelda is because you have stats, particularly health (your hit points in the top-left), attack (the damage you deal), and defence (the reduction in damage you take). And levelling up is quite interesting; you only level up once you clear a room’s enemies, where a random stat (I assume it’s just predetermined by the room) levels up. This means that you can never grind; you can only be diligent in taking out all the enemies in a room. I never found it a tricky task to find the enemies given that you’ve got a radar by pressing Start to find them.About half-way in the dungeons here you come across another mystical portal which specifically lets you transform into a character called Freedan, the Dark Knight, who allows you to deal a little more damage, and his sword reaches a little further, allowing you to hit some enemies that couldn’t be reached before. I found it interesting later on in the game where they kept giving both Will and Freedan different abilities that they could use, leading to some interesting puzzles later on where you’d have to find a portal and swap between characters to continue on. It’s a nice way just to get you to switch between these characters, even if they played fairly similarly. Oddly, there’s a third character who only shows up in the second last area of the game, and, again, plays very similarly, although since he doesn’t have any unlockable abilities, he seems a bit basic compared to the other two characters.The dungeon at some point ends, introducing you to a weird character called Lilly, who can turn into a dandelion. All this means is they can talk to you sometimes without appearing in the field. You rescue Kara, run back to your village to find your grandparents’ place ransacked, and you set off to find the mystical village that they have fled to, which can only be found by playing the song you learned on the flute. This begins the game’s rhythm where you go through a dungeon of some kind, talk to some characters for a bit, and then rinse and repeat as you discover the new dungeons. Most of the time the dungeon leads you into a new are such that you can’t return to an older area anyways, so it’s a fairly linear trek throughout the game.The next dungeon in the game is a bit rinse repeat of the same mechanics, but each dungeon introduces different enemies, each having various amounts of health and attack patterns. I liked how they’re all fairly easy to understand in isolation, encouraging you to manage moving around and minimising the number of times you get hit. Later in the game I found that you have so much health you can tank a fair bit of the harder to dodge stuff, since you always get a Gaia healing/save room just before the bosses. And the bosses are very difficult; the first one requires 20 hits to defeat, only exposing his face after hurling these fireballs that bounce around the room at odd angles, firebars that sweep across the ledges you stand on, and in between hits, these lasers that are so unpredictable in where exactly they’ll hit. Fortunately you collect these herbs that you can use in battle to supplement the damage, but it’s such a difficulty spike when you’ve never felt that you’ve needed herbs at all up to this point.Later bosses do range in difficulty a little bit but I’d say the first one is the second hardest behind the twin vampires about half-way through the game. There are two enemies, each taking 20 hits, dancing around this Bomberman-styled grid, sending firebars down each column and row, and every time you hit them they create a shield of fireballs. They also team up, creating another bouncing projectile that absolutely demolishes your health. All of this is done while there’s a bomb in the room with a character strapped to it counting down.And any time you die, you lose a life and reappear just outside the boss room with half of your health. I ended up just resetting the system every time, since you always save just before a boss, and you get full health, and all your herbs that you may’ve burned in your last run. Herbs are not replenishable too; there’s only a finite number that appear in the game, so you’ve ultimately got to either conserve them or get good and beat the bosses without taking any hits. I found it so strange though because I never had any problem outside of the bosses though, especially finding it a breeze once I had so much health near the end of the game. But the bosses were very hard to avoid all damage on, which contributed to their difficulty. Still, I guess, it only took a handful of attempts at any point before I finally got it right and could continue on.The dungeons themselves though were fairly interesting, each having their own kinds of puzzles. One dungeon mid-way through the game involves finding four statues in the corners of a hub room, and each had puzzles where you’d flip over to the underside of the floating platforms to trigger switches or navigate the area differently. Another involved navigating the Great Wall of China (making the dungeon much more left-right focused), but having all of these various rooms vertically throughout the place. These are complemented by interesting enemies for their environments. In the above examples, the first had different forms of enemies that attacked differently depending on whether you were on the top side or underside of the dungeon. In the Great Wall dungeon, you had various archer enemies that fired arrows down the corridors, requiring you to carefully time approaches and dodge vertically when available. It all felt very solid, especially as you gathered new combat abilities.The last big thing to talk about is the story; it begins in this fairly quaint way, but constantly hints at something greater. As you go through the game, you collect six Mystic Statues that are used to open up the Tower of Babel. There’s not really a roadmap of where these statues are; you just seem to come across them as you casually head into each dungeon, but there’s something rather sinister about each place you somehow come across. One place has brightly lit front street with petals falling down all over the place, but the back streets had hooded characters discussing child slave trades, and you’d later go into those slave mines to free everyone. A later area was inhabited by many monsters, and after killing the boss, all the monsters turned into regular people, implying that you’ve just been murdering regular people for a while. Another place had a popular gambling ring going on, and you enter a challenge to win some camels to cross the desert. The game you play involves five bottles where one has poison. You drink two, the man you challenge drinks two, and obviously the last one contains the poison, but the man disregards the crowd and says he has nothing to live for but his pride, and swallows the poison dying immediately. The scene transitions back to his wife saying you’ve inherited the camels in his will and that, and I quote, “real joy is being with those you love”. There’s quite a number of these moments that are just bitterly grim throughout the game.And yet, we get into the part that ultimately confuses me. At one point in the game, Will receives a vision of the future; a world covered in grey repetitive buildings, with no forests, rivers, or landscapes to be seen. I got the hint that the game was trying to say, while the natural world is a bit dangerous, overdevelopment ruins the natural beauty of the land (since all the dungeons take place at real historical monuments). Ultimately, at the end of the game, Will has to leave the world he lives in to tackle a threat on an incoming comet (which wasn’t really mentioned much throughout the game, I thought this was ultimately a quest for his father), and after defeating the final boss, has to return to the Earth at a completely different time period to what he was used to. Almost like a cyclical rebirth as there exists a modern day version of every character to which he begins his new life with again, but it’s not exactly the dystopian future that was hinted at early. It also is honestly way better than dealing with the demons, child slavery rings, cannibals, gamblers and tyrants in the fantasy world that he used to be in. There’s barely any time to focus on the positive things that happen to the main characters before they’re thrown into the next bit of adversity. And while the adversity certainly develops these characters (all having some arc of some kind), the ultimate message seemed a bit lost on me as I wasn’t sure whether it was trying to warn people about the dangers of modernity.Despite being confused with the story, the game is fairly substantial for its 12-hour playtime, and I got a lot of good enjoyment out of it. The presentation is fairly good, with well composed music (although nothing that subjectively memorable for me), fairly good SNES graphics (they won’t wow you but they look good for what the system can do), a story that’s at least engaging, and gameplay that keeps developing over its length. It’s got a fair number of unique elements to it that set it apart from other titles of its time, such as the levelling up system and the smooth presentation. I also did find the variety in environments really fun throughout the experience, and having new abilities, enemies, and puzzles along the way really spiced everything up. It’s ultimately a fun but flawed title; one to casually playthrough, remembering the good bits, and learning how games have developed from its rougher aspects, but certainly one to give a check if you’re interested in games such as A Link to the Past or Crystalis." }, { "title": "Review - Pokémon Trading Card Game (GBC)", "url": "/posts/review-pokemon-trading-card-game-gbc/", "categories": "Review", "tags": "video-game, review, gbc, pokémon, retroachievements", "date": "2022-06-08 16:40:00 +1000", "snippet": "A little exploitable, but probably one of the most well presented card games on a handheld for perhaps two generations.I only found out very recently that the Pokémon Trading Card Game was originally released to Japan in October 1996 (8 months after the release of Red and Green), but was released in Western countries by Wizards of the Coast in January 1999. This video game version was released in December 1998 in Japan, and April 2000 in the USA, and more importantly, here in Australia (they seemed to skip localising for multiple languages for the Australian release, which probably explains the spellings of color in the game). The game was also made after the Jungle and Fossil expansions to the card game were released, and includes some of those cards, as well as a few promotional cards, and some exclusive cards only ever created for the game and never actually printed.I cannot remember how much of the game I actually played; I don’t think I got too into it as a kid but I do somewhat remember getting the two player starter deck at the time. It was a fun idea to have two full decks that you could mix and match between: one a fighting typed deck, and the other a fire type. I don’t remember getting any booster packs though, I think my parents probably thought it was a money sink right away, and unfortunately I never knew anyone who got into it while growing up (it was more a Yu-Gi-Oh kind of place). That being said, I also got this game way back then probably close to when it came out, and I remember enjoying it so much. I also did a playthrough of it for my YouTube channel back in 2012, so I must’ve enjoyed it a lot.Immediately off the bat, you can tell how well this game’s presentation is. The game features an overworld system similar to the actual Pokémon game (singular since this was made before Gold and Silver), but interestingly, it feels buttery smooth, and features a run button (which wouldn’t appear in a main Pokémon game for another five years). Once you’re in battle, there’s tonnes of information available on screen at all times. I also love how hitting Start in the battles shows more detail about your own Pokémon, holding B and pressing Start shows info about your opponent’s Pokémon, B and down to show your bench, and B and up to show your opponent’s bench. Lots of quick subtle but intuitive shortcuts to easily jump around the field and quickly understand the situation, rather than constantly digging through dialogue menus like later Yu-Gi-Oh titles.The actual gameplay of the TCG though? It’s a little simple, and sometimes a bit too easy to exploit unfortunately. You effectively play the game with a 60 card deck each, drawing 7 to start off. Pokémon at the beginning of their evolution chain are Basic Pokémon and can be played immediately, but any evolution card must be played in subsequent turns on top of the Basic Pokémon. Pokémon also need energy cards (one can be played per turn), and once they have enough cards to meet a threshold, they can use a move listed on the card. Pokémon have either one or two moves so your options with one Pokémon are fairly simple, as it usually means you have either the weaker move with fewer energies required, or the better move with more energies once you have more later on. Some cards have two moves that operate under a little bit of luck or strategy (in Nidorino’s case, one move does two coin flips, and deals 30 damage for each heads, the other move is a flat 50 damage), but usually it’s not too hard knowing what move to use.You can also retreat your Pokémon by discarding energies equipped to it (the number is listed on the card). I didn’t find myself using this often; it’s often better to just stick it out until your Pokémon runs out of health, but sometimes you’ve set up something better on the bench that you’ll sweep the rest of the match with. Finally, Pokémon have an associated type, and can have one type marked as a weakness (where all incoming damage from a Pokémon of that type is doubled) and a resistance (which reduces that type of incoming damage by 30). You can cheese some of the game by using a deck that favours Pokémon with certain resistances or exploits an opponent’s primary weakness. Almost all of the opponent decks in the game are strongly typed (and frankly, because you can only use the specific energies listed on each card, you’re usually forced into doing that yourself as well).But the game itself is a fairly faithful adaptation of the TCG rules, warts and all. There will be some matches where you will lose because you had a bad draw, and some matches that, I’m not even joking, are over in one turn in your favour because your opponent had a bad draw. In my run-through, the final battle of the game went that way; he only drew three energies early into the match and could never attack afterwards. There’s unfortunately not a lot of depth to the actual gameplay, but what makes it engrossing is having these sub-optimal but at least working setups early on in the game, and slowly picking up more of the cards you’d want through the game. There’s four booster pack pools in the game, and different trainers give you 20 cards from a certain pool every time you beat them. But there’s enough trainers that you’re never really refighting the same person often much to beat the game.So to contextualise these duels, the game effectively is a gym-only version of the main Pokémon game; you need eight badges to be able to challenge the four Grand Masters, and claim the Legendary Cards, all while having a rival meet you at various points in the game. The overworld is just a map select to go between the various locations; most of which are just the gyms. And the gyms are all just rooms with various duellists in them. Some gyms allow you to challenge the leader immediately and some require you to fight the other three people in the room first, but the formula is fairly simple, and the pacing is surprisingly fast (you’ll be done with each gym in about half an hour each). By being so fast, you get the opportunity to change your deck styles fairly quick between the gyms, which is nice. I went between four decks throughout the game with some minor improvements in each when I needed to jump back to a certain type.This rhythm is slightly spiced up by having to fight your rival after the 2nd and 5th badges, and also optionally doing a tournament where you fight two random other duellists…and the rival after the 3rd and 5th badges. Here in lies a bit of an interesting issue though; nothing tells you explicitly that the tournament runs at those times; you just have to wander into the building and hear the music to know you can enter, but if you get one more badge before doing it, you miss the opportunity to get the exclusive card earned from there. Also losing to the rival at any point also means you lose your opportunity to get an exclusive card. The cards are never needed but it’s a bit of a bummer once you first find out. Interestingly, there’s a few trades in the game as well with NPCs; one of which takes all your unused energy cards if you say yes, and if you say no, he leaves and the card he reveals never appears. Every other trade card can be gotten at whatever point later in the game, although I found that the very last cards I seemed to randomly find were the ones that were required for these trades (bad luck on my end).There’s a little bit of the can be cheated a little bit. The game allows you to quickly save the game at any time between duels, which also includes these multi-duel tournaments. If you’re losing a match, you can just hit A, B, Start, and Select, and immediately mash A a few times to pop yourself back at the beginning. But you’ll also notice an option called Continue Duel, and to my surprise the first time I played the game, it returns you back to your duel at the exact point you left off as a player. You can place an energy on your Pokémon, reset a frame later, and the game will have saved that. You get one catch, as the game doesn’t save your attack step until you start your next turn. You can’t reset the game to cheese coin flips though, as all the coin flips follow a randomised, but deterministic pattern once the duel starts. However, this means, if you have a move that fails because of a bad coin flip, you can reset and opt for a different strategy. I usually relied on delaying those bad coin flips for my opponent so he would also fail. It’s very easy to exploit, and, while saving time, it’s something you would easily find yourself if you were playing.The AI never particularly seems to cheat in this game; mostly because you can’t do too much to throw off your opponent. You have to play your deck’s strategy using the cards you manage to draw that game. That fortunately means there’s not too many moments where the game feels cheap, although you’ll feel it a little bit of a match starts going wrong because you never drew that certain evolution card, or your opponent used Scoop Up on his Chansey for the third time when it had eleven of its twelve damage tokens.Lastly, the music is very memorable. All of it sounds as GameBoy as you’d expect with its 8-bit tones and fairly simple instrumentation, but each track is fairly distinct, and, again, since the game isn’t too long, they never feel like they get old. I particularly love how the Grand Master music works in two sections; both using a common ostinato-pattern melody, but differing by their basslines and density in the percussion voice. It builds up drama at the point in the game that needs the drama most, which is definitely a feat for a card game where the drama could be at any point in the match.The RetroAchievements set for this game is fairly standard; most of the achievements are for clearing through the game, or doing the optional trades and tournaments. I’ve still yet to collect every card just yet but it should be doable after fighting various quick to beat duellists again until those cards randomly roll. However, there’s one achievement which involves collecting 99 of every energy in the game, which is an absolute pain. You start the game (after talking to someone) with about 20 of each energy, and every duel gives you…about 2 energies total. There’s a very specific duel at the beginning of the game that lets you play out a deterministic tutorial duel, and you’re rewarded with 10 energies at the end of that. That means, you’re effectively delegated to playing that tutorial duel at least 60 times, all with very little effect for the rest of the game. It’s long and doesn’t really add any challenge to the set since it’s just the tutorial.But overall, I had a great time beating this game again in 6 hours. It surprised me how quick this game actually was, but I think it’s due to how smooth and immediate the presentation is, how little downtime there is between duels, and how much opportunity you have to succeed without grinding or blindly throwing yourself at opponents. It’s strange as well given how its strengths were never quite replicated in other Pokémon games, or other TCG-styled games on handhelds. And, very oddly, it has a sequel I’ve yet to experience that was only ever released in Japan. But for what this game is on its own, despite maybe some very easy exploitation to speed things up, it’s definitely a nice fun and short play, it wasn’t frustrating, and it’s got some great music tracks with it." } ]
