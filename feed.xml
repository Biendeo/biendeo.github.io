Inoffensive until it ends. This just randomly came on my radar as a collect-a-thon game developed by the same people as Muppet Monster Madness (a game I have streamed before), but it’s been probably 20 years since I last saw Stuart Little 2, and I cannot for the lif... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Review - XIII (PC)</title><link href="https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-xiii-pc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review - XIII (PC)" /><published>2022-06-20T07:00:00+10:00</published> <updated>2022-06-20T07:00:00+10:00</updated> <id>https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-xiii-pc/</id> <content src="https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-xiii-pc/" /> <author> <name>Biendeo</name> </author> <category term="Review" /> <summary> A varied and decent FPS, graced by a unique art style and soundtrack, but littered with annoying gameplay mechanics and unfortunately poor PC scaling performance. XIII’s been on my radar for a while after seeing a Gggmanlives video on it ages ago. It seemed like an interesting game to play, especially given that it was some obscure early 2000s shooter by Ubisoft Paris of all studios. It had ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Review - Illusion of Gaia (SNES)</title><link href="https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-illusion-of-gaia-snes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review - Illusion of Gaia (SNES)" /><published>2022-06-12T10:21:00+10:00</published> <updated>2022-06-12T10:21:00+10:00</updated> <id>https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-illusion-of-gaia-snes/</id> <content src="https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-illusion-of-gaia-snes/" /> <author> <name>Biendeo</name> </author> <category term="Review" /> <summary> A solid 12-hour adventure with various developments both in environments and story, albeit with unexpectedly difficult bosses and a bit of a confusing ending. I had only ever heard of Illusion of Gaia in various “best of SNES RPGs” lists around the internet, but I had never seen any gameplay, or played any of the developer Quintet’s other titles. This was a bit of a blind “let’s see how we g... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Review - Pokémon Trading Card Game (GBC)</title><link href="https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-pokemon-trading-card-game-gbc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review - Pokémon Trading Card Game (GBC)" /><published>2022-06-08T16:40:00+10:00</published> <updated>2022-06-12T12:47:12+10:00</updated> <id>https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-pokemon-trading-card-game-gbc/</id> <content src="https://www.biendeo.com/posts/review-pokemon-trading-card-game-gbc/" /> <author> <name>Biendeo</name> </author> <category term="Review" /> <summary> A little exploitable, but probably one of the most well presented card games on a handheld for perhaps two generations. I only found out very recently that the Pokémon Trading Card Game was originally released to Japan in October 1996 (8 months after the release of Red and Green), but was released in Western countries by Wizards of the Coast in January 1999. This video game version was relea... </summary> </entry> </feed>
